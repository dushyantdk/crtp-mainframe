        <h3>18. Risks</h3>
       <p class="conts">18.1. The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual currencies, involves significant risks. Prices can fluctuate on any given day. Due to such price fluctuations, you may increase or lose value in your assets at any given moment. Any currency, virtual or not, may be subject to large or sudden shifts in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market. You should be aware that the risk of loss in trading or holding Digital Currencies can be substantial.</p><p class="conts">18.2.  Digital  Currency  trading  also  has  special  risks  not  generally  shared  with  official currencies or goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by  governments  or  other  legal  entities,  or  by  commodities  such  as  gold  or  silver, Digital Currency is a unique kind of currency, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank or government regulator that can take corrective measures to protect the value of the Digital Currency in a crisis, issue more currency, or balance the price fluctuations.</p><p class="conts">18.3. Instead, Digital Currency is an autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of currency firms and individuals. Traders and market participants put their trust in a digital, decentralized and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity. Thus, the value of Digital Currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange Fiat Currency for Digital Currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular Digital Currency should the market for that Digital Currency disappear.</p><p class="conts">18.4. Digital Currency trading may be susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse relative to demand and supply. For example, confidence in Digital Currency might collapse as a result of unexpected changes imposed by software developers or others, a government  crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems, for example, if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent transactions from settling.</p><p class="conts">18.5. Transactions in the Digital Currency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.</p><p class="conts">18.6. Due to the nature of Digital Currency, any technological difficulties experienced by the Company could prevent the access or use of a Member’s Digital Currency.</p><p class="conts">18.7. The above mentioned is not a closed list, there may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use. You should carefully assess whether your financial  standing  and  tolerance  for  risk  are  suitable  for  buying,  selling  or  trading  Digital Currency.</p><p class="conts">18.8.  The Company  uses  banking  providers  in  order  to  receive  your  funds  and  to  make payments. Our  banking  providers  do  not  transfer  Digital  Currency,  exchange  Digital Currency, or provide any services in connection with Digital Currency.</p><p class="conts">18.9. Markets for Digital Currency have varying degrees of liquidity. Some are quite liquid while  others  may  be  thinner  or illiquid.  The  Company  does  not  guaranteeany  profit  from trading or any other activity associated with the site.</p><p class="conts">18.10. IN LIGHT OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED  RISKS, WHICH  ARE NOT A COMPREHENSIVE LIST, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER IF HOLDING DIGITAL CURRENCY IS SUITABLE FOR YOU DEPENDING ON YOUR FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>
